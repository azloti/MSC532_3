## Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

You can run both files using python 3, by running "python quick_sort.py" or "python hash.py" from the terminal.

You can find the reports in their separate [quick sort](Quick Sort.md) and [hash](Hashing With Chaining.md) files.


Quick Sort summary:

The findings show that quick sort works significantly better for partially sorted arrays, while offering similar performance for truly random arrays.
