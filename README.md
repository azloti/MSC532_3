## Assignment 3: Understanding Algorithm Efficiency and Scalability

### Running the project:

You can run both files using python 3, by running "python quick_sort.py" or "python hash.py" from the terminal.


### Reports:
You can find the reports in their separate [quick sort](Quick%20Sort.md) and [hashing with chaining](Hashing%20With%20Chaining.md) files.


### Quick Sort summary:

The findings show that quick sort works significantly better for partially sorted arrays, while offering similar performance for truly random arrays.
